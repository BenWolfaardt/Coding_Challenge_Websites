# Practice Coding Challenges

This repository contains various challenges that I have worked through in order to increase my skills in Data Structures as well as programming in general. 
Each branch represents the source (book/website) as well as language in which the "coding Challenge" has been solved. 

> As not to ocupy too many repositories with "tutorials" I've decided to group them into a single repository by making use of the `git`'s `orphan` command - allowing you to have independent branches with their own independant `git` history. Further details can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/BenWolfaardt/50905fa3e10d73b3622a3148afffed09).
