# Practice Coding Challenges

This repository contains various challenges that I have worked through in order to increase my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms. 
Each branch represents the source (book/website) as well as language in which the _coding challenge_ has been solved. 

> As not to ocupy too many repositories with "tutorials" I've decided to group them into a single repository using `git checkout --orphan` - [further details](https://gist.github.com/BenWolfaardt/50905fa3e10d73b3622a3148afffed09).
